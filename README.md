## [fastlane match](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/match/)

This repository contains all your certificates and provisioning profiles needed to build and sign your applications. They are encrypted using OpenSSL via a passphrase.

**Important:** Make sure this repository is set to private and only your team members have access to this repo.

Do not modify this file, as it gets overwritten every time you run _match_.

### Installation

Make sure you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:

```
xcode-select --install
```

Install _fastlane_ using

```
[sudo] gem install fastlane -NV
```

or alternatively using `brew install fastlane`

### Usage

Navigate to your project folder and run

```
fastlane match appstore
```

```
fastlane match adhoc
```

```
fastlane match development
```

```
fastlane match enterprise
```

### Renew an expired certificate

Nuke command revoke your certificates and provisioning profiles, which leave you a clean slate for a new beginning.

```
fastlane match nuke development
fastlane match nuke distribution
fastlane match nuke enterprise
```

After clearing your account, you'll start from a clean slate, and you can run match to generate your certificates and profiles again.

```
fastlane match appstore
fastlane match adhoc
fastlane match development
```
